# CareerMatch Pro

This is a Next.js application for CareerMatch Pro, an AI-powered career and recruitment platform.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (or a similar package manager) installed.

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to install all the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Next.js development server with this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:9002`.

### 3. Run the AI Development Server (Optional)

This project uses Genkit for its AI features. To run the Genkit development server, which allows you to inspect and test your AI flows, run the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

You can then access the Genkit developer UI, usually at `http://localhost:4000`.
